# GifTastic

This app uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery to retrieve 10 random gifs via an ajax call to the giphy API.  It then renders them unanimated and each gif can be toggled between animated and unanimated by clicking on it.

Additional celebrity buttons can be dynamically created via the form input.
